# Objective

GOML2 aims to be:

* The most comprehensive ML library written in Go.
* Zero dependencies

While I aim to make this friendly for use in production, it's not an objective.

I intend for this library to be used directly through its APIs. It's interesting
to think that we could also turn this into a binary for easy manipulation of
models & hyperparameters as well as datasets, but that's currently not an
objective.

# Pre-beta timeline

I'm not sure when what the requirements are for checking these off, but I'll
use this list as a rough timeline for development.

[ ] - Dataset manipulation  
[ ] - Dataset visualization  
[ ] - Regression trees  
[ ] - Classification trees  
[ ] - Gradient boosting  
...
